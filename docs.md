# ðŸ§© Mockup Canvas Frontend â€” Technical Documentation

## 1. Objective

Develop a web application that allows users to **overlay design images onto blank T-shirt mockups** directly in the browser with **persistent database storage**.
Users can:
- Upload mockup images (plain T-shirt base).
- Upload design images (transparent background).
- Drag, scale, rotate, and adjust the opacity of designs.
- Choose blend modes to make designs naturally blend with fabric.
- Save files to an SQLite database.
- Manage saved files with dedicated Manager modal (permanent deletion).
- Load saved files into workspace with Show Mockup modal.
- Export final mockups as high-quality PNG files or ZIP archives.

## 2. Scope

- **Fullstack application** with Express backend and SQLite database.
- **Database persistence** for mockup files.
- **Separate workflows** for file management and workspace loading.
- **Memory-efficient** file handling with proper cleanup.
