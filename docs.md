# ðŸ§© Mockup Canvas Frontend â€” Technical Documentation

## 1. Objective

Develop a web application that allows users to **overlay design images onto blank T-shirt mockups** directly in the browser, **without any backend**.  
Users can:
- Upload a mockup image (plain T-shirt base).  
- Upload a design image (transparent background).  
- Drag, scale, rotate, and adjust the opacity of the design.  
- Choose a blend mode to make the design naturally blend with the fabric.  
- Export the final mockup as a high-quality PNG file.

## 2. Scope

- **Frontend-only processing**, no data stored on the server.  
- No authentication or database required.  
- Can be extended later with a backend (Node.js + Sharp or Python + Pillow).
